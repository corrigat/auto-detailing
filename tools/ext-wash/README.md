Be mindful that these are just what I use. There are other products on the market that work just as well. You may even already have some.

# Foam Canon and 2-bucket

* Sun Joe SPX3001 2030 PSI 1.76GPM pressure washer or equivilant. You want at least 1700 PSI.

* 2 Grit guards and buckets. I like bucket sets with lids. Any grit guard and bucket combo works.

* Foam Canon. MTM makes a good one that isn't too high priced. There are other decent canons for less, but this one was highly recommended and I'm satisfied with the cost.

* Wash Mitt. Anything microfiber. Two packs with high ratings are nice.

* Soap. You'd think soaps would cost pennies with how many are on the market. There are a lot of good soaps. I prefer soaps marketed for use with foam canons. You don't need all of these, they're just examples.

* Brushes. Remember to mark these for paint, interior, and wheels to avoid scratching or chemical sadness. Anything you find in a set is probably the best value. Try to stick with boar or horse hair.

* Drying Towels. I like to keep a few on hand 'cause for some reason I suck at using them. Really, just take your pick from highly reviewed microfiber towels marketed for drying.
